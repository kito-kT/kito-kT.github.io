Finally have a static site for blog posts! We're live! It's been rough past pandemic but glad plants are growing (photos coming soon) and finally feel direction in learning frontend development. Currently learning javascript in hopes of applying to frontend development on the ethereum blockchain. This might change as blockchain work seems to be volitile but as a young learner the tech seems cool but seems to be missing great frontend work. More soon.
