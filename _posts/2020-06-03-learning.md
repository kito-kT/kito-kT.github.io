Finally finished going through javascript. Pretty useful language and I can say reading through react-based websites finally don't look like hieroglyphics. Now its time to focus on React and Next, seeing as they seem to be the most popular frameworks for web development.

I can't stop thinking about blockchain. I'm definitely obsessed, maybe I should just give up on trying to avoid it and just jump in head first. Fine, time to learn soliditiy. It's always difficult to know where to start with learning, I feel like the best way I to learn is to do. Unfornately there isn't a bunch out there but there are youtube videos and I think codewars. So lets start there. I think Hannah was right, it may be helpful to explain what I'm learning to make sure I understand it well enough because if I ever want to use this technology I want to be well versed. So stay tooned for illustrations and more posts.
